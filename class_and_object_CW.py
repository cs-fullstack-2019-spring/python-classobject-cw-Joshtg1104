# ### Problem 1:
# Create a class Dog. Make sure it has the attributes name, breed, color, gender.
# Create a function that will print all attributes of the class.
# Create an object of Dog in your problem1 function and print all of it's attributes.

def problem1():
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, breed, color, gender):
            self.name = name

# ### Problem 2:
# ##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
# Create a function that has a loop that quits with the equal sign.
# If the user doesn't enter the equal sign, ask them to input another string.

def problem2():

# ### Problem 3:
# In your main file create three Person objects. Change the weight and height of each one.
# Afterwards, print the BMI (body mass index) of each Person.
# If you donâ€™t know how to calculate BMI, look at the code I provided for you.
# <strong>Hint</strong>: BMI is (weight / (height * height)) x 703. Weight is in pounds and height is in inches.
# <strong>Extra</strong>:Put the three person objects in an array and use a loop to print out their BMIs.

# ### Problem 4:
# Create a class Product that represents a product sold online. A product has a name, price, and quantity.
# The class should have changeProduct:
# a) If changeProduct has one parameter, it can change the name of the product.
# b) If changeProduct has two parameters it can change the name and price of the product.
# c) If changeProduct has three parameters it can change the name, price, and quantity of the product.
# Create an object of Product in your problem4 function and print all of it's attributes.

#     Settled for just creating 3 seperate functions.
